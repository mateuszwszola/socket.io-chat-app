# Socket.io chat application

This is my first socket.io application. The chat is from https://socket.io/get-started/chat, but I improved it and I added things from "Homework" section

## Getting Started

```bash

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the app with nodemon
npm run dev

# Server runs on http://localhost:3000
```
